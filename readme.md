# Optical Flow Estimation Using OpenCV

This project is being used as a stepping stone to my Dynamic texture video projects. We are using this code to estimate optical flow and use it later for Dynamic Texture Identification - Originally developed 04/05/2018



## What was developed in this project 
A system for reading multiple videos and translating them into optical flow information. The videos were collected from a Dynamic Texture dataset which is vital for later Dynamic Texture based projects.

 In this project, the open-source library OpenCV was used for the collection of Optical Flow from regular RGB video.
